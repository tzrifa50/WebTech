    <h2>31 Runs in One Over: A New Record in Bangladesh Cricket</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Bangladesh had one of their most exciting cricket moments during the Rising Stars Asia Cup in Doha, Qatar. In their opening match, they shocked everyone by scoring 31 runs in a single over. This is the highest that Bangladesh has ever scored in one over in any recognized T20 match, and the moment immediately went viral among fans.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The match started normally, but everything changed when opener Habibur Rahman Sohan began batting in an aggressive way. From the beginning he looked confident and started hitting boundaries all around the ground. He reached fifty in only 14 balls, which is extremely fast by any standard. After that he did not slow down and kept playing his shots. His century came in just 34 balls, which is now the fastest T20 hundred for Bangladesh. Many cricket lovers were surprised by how easily he played the bowlers.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      But the main highlight came in the very last over of the innings. Captain Akbar Ali was on strike after Sohan took a single from the first ball. Akbar then hit five sixes in a row. Each shot went over the boundary with clean timing, and the bowler Kinchit Shah could not control the situation. Every delivery he bowled ended up being punished. The crowd became louder after every six, and the excitement grew with each shot.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      With one single and five sixes, Bangladesh collected a total of 31 runs from that over. This broke their previous record and created a new milestone in Bangladesh cricket history. Fans on social media celebrated the achievement and called it one of the best batting overs by a Bangladeshi team. Cricket experts said that this performance shows how the younger players of Bangladesh are growing with more confidence, and that they may create even more records in the future if they continue playing with this level of courage and skill.

    <h2>Why Famous Scientists Like Stephen Hawking Never Won the Nobel Prize</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      The Nobel Prize is often seen as the most respected award in science. It is given to discoveries that have been clearly proven and accepted by the scientific community. Even though many brilliant scientists changed the world with their theories, not all of them received the Nobel Prize. One famous example is Stephen Hawking.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Stephen Hawking was known for his work on black holes and the universe. He spent his entire life working on theories that explain how the universe functions on both the smallest and largest levels. One of his most well-known ideas is called Hawking Radiation. According to this theory, black holes slowly release tiny particles over time. This surprised scientists because it linked quantum mechanics and general relativity, two major fields of physics that usually do not fit together easily.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Many people believed Hawking deserved a Nobel Prize because of how important and original his ideas were. His theories changed the way scientists understand black holes and the universe. However, the main problem was that Hawking Radiation could not be tested directly. Black holes are extremely far away and very difficult to measure. The Nobel Prize requires strong experimental proof, and since no one could observe Hawking Radiation during Hawking’s lifetime, he was not eligible for the award.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
      Even without the Nobel Prize, Stephen Hawking’s work remains extremely valuable. His theories continue to influence new research, and scientists still study his ideas today. Some believe that with new technology, Hawking Radiation might be detected in the future. If that happens, it would finally prove his theory. Hawking may not have won the Nobel Prize, but his contributions and influence will continue for many years to come.
